Delete 04 and 05 are not needed!

Delete 00: Test to check whether deletion of a user was successful.
Delete 01: Test to check whether the person that is deleting the 
			account of another user is an Admin.
Delete 02: Test to check if any outstanding tickets for purchase or sale 
			are cancelled before deletion of the account.
Delete 03: Test to confirm that the username of the account to be deleted
			must be the name of an existing user.
Delete 06: Test to confirm if the user that is deleting an account does 
			not have the same username (basically no self-deletion).
