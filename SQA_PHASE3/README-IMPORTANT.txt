We could not get the shell (.sh) to work!
However we tried our best, you can edit the .sh file to view our attempt!

I would strongly advise against running the .sh file because it may cause
output file to get overloaded with data infinitevely.

Therefore, we have manually did the testing by going through each test cases and
fixing the issues and errors (same for terminal output)!

You may run the ticket-seller.exe file to run our program without the need
to compile!

The code and updated version of our 3rd phase is in the 
"Ticket Selling System First Version" directory!

Sorry for any inconvinience!
